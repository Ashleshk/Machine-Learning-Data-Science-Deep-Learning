 ## Projects
 1. CNN for NLP
 2. Simple CNN for NLP with Language Translations
 3. Transformers

 ## What you'll learn
* Build a Transformer, new model created by Google, for any sequence to sequence task (e.g. a translator)
* Build a CNN specialized in NLP for any classification task (e.g. sentimental analysis)
* Write a custom training process for more advanced training methods in NLP
* Create customs layers and models in TF 2.0 for specific NLP tasks
* Use Google Colab and Tensorflow 2.0 for your AI implementations
* Pick the best model for each NLP task
* Understand how we get computers to give meaning to the human language
* Create datasets for AI from those data
* Clean text data Understand why and how each of those models work
* Understand everything about the attention mechanism, lying behind the newest and most powerful NLP algorithms
